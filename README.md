# WHIRLPOOL REBATE CENTER
The Whirlpool Rebate and Promotion Center website was built to make submitting rebates a seamless experience.
The inspiration for the design was taken from other Rebate Center's done before, but I was able to design this with Whirlpool's branding in mind. I incorporated a nice step-by-step progress bar so the user knows exactly where they are in the experience at all times. Once the creative design was approved by the client, I began building the responsive prototype. I wanted to make sure the user had the same experience on both mobile and desktop.
